# vim

I use vim under [Arch Linux](https://github.com/OpcodePete/Arch-Linux).

vim is an editor... it is powerful... it is ubiquitous... it is all-purpose... it's shortcuts are optimised... wim will change the way you look at a comptuer and how you do things!

Modern IDEs are fantastic. I should know. I have been developing commercially with Microsoft Visual Studio commerially since the 90s. But many developers (also) use vim.
