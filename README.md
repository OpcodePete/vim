# vim

vim is an editor... it is powerful... it is ubiquitous... it is all-purpose... it's shortcuts are optimised... vim will change the way you look at a comptuer and how you do things.

I have been developing software with Microsoft Visual Studio since the 90s, and modern IDEs are fantastic! But, many developers still use vim!

This repo contains my notes on vim, i.e. how to use vim, how to setup vim as an IDE, and more.
