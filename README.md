# vim

vim is an editor... it is powerful... it is ubiquitous... it is all-purpose... it's shortcuts are optimised... wim will change the way you look at a comptuer and how you do things!

Modern IDEs are fantastic, I should know as I've been using Microsoft Visual Studio commerially since the 90s, but many developers (including myself) also use vim. 

I use vim under [Arch Linux](https://github.com/OpcodePete/Arch-Linux).
