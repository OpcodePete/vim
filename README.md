# vim

vim is an editor. It is powerful, all-purpose, ubiquitous, and it's shortcuts are optimised.

vim will change the way you look at a comptuer and how you do things.

I have been developing software using Microsoft Visual Studio since the 90s. Modern IDEs are fantastic! But many developers still use vim!

This repo contains my notes, a cheat sheet, how to use vim, and more.

Regarding plugin managers, I had been installing vim plugins without a plugin manager for years, until I finally decided to try a few of the popular plugin managers. I ended up using `vim-plug`, in my opinion it is the best.
