# vim

vim is an editor, it is powerful, all-purpose, ubiquitous, shortcuts are optimised... vim will change the way you look at a comptuer and how you do things.

I have been developing software using Microsoft Visual Studio since the 90s - modern IDEs are fantastic! But, many developers still use vim!

This repo contains my notes on vim, i.e. cheat sheet, how to use vim, how to setup vim as an IDE, and more.

**Plugin manager**

Having installed many plugin manually for a long time, then trying a numhber of the popular plugin managers, I found `vim-plug` to be the best.
